A site or application can run on a wide range of computers, laptops, tablets and phones, as well as a handful of other things (watches, thermostats, fridges, etc.). How you determine what things you'll support and how you will develop to support those things is called a multi-thing development strategy. Below, I list the most common multi-thing development strategies.

* Build a [responsive (RWD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) web site/app for all things.
* Build a [RESS (responsive web design with server-side components)](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1392) web site/app for all things.
* Build an [adaptive/progressively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_web_design) enhanced web site/app for all things.
* Build a website, web app, native app, or hybrid-native app for each individual thing or a grouping of things.
* Attempt to retrofit something you have already built using bits and parts from strategies 1, 2 or 3. This could be as simple as sprinkling in some screen-size agnostic UI parts or attempting to fully support other things with the entire UI.
