# In 2017 expect...

* [Web Assembly](http://webassembly.org/), might just peak.
* `import` might just be [usable](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import#example) in `<script></script>`
* Universal JavaScript solutions will continue to rise that pay homage/respect to the days of [server delivered front-ends (i.e. html to the client)](https://github.com/zeit/next.js).
* Reactive programming continues to thrive in the JavaScript scene. (see MobX and RxJS).
* React, more so the concept, will dominate. React itself will be completely re-written (see [React Fiber](https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture)) or evolve (see [Inferno](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno)).
* Angular found SEMVER so Angular 4 (even 5) is on the [roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJIMoLgqU_o&feature=youtu.be&t=6m12s) for 2017.
* A return to simple websites may happen, web 1.0 retro, but with the help of 2017 tools (i.e. [static site generation](https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter/tree/blendid))
* RESTful JSON APIs will get more competition (see [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/))
* Could be a banner year for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
* More devs will abandon traditional CMS solutions for static site generators & [API CMS tools](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS712US713&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=api%20cms).
* More people will move from Sass to [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) + cssnext.
* Lots more HTTP2 and HTTPS.
* Web components will continue to lurk and wait for significant traction by developers that might never come to be.
* The no framework, framework, faction will gain momentum (see [Svelte](https://svelte.technology/blog/frameworks-without-the-framework/)).
* JavaScript will settle, and hopefully, CSS will erupt and everyone will cry fatigue until it settles.
* Hatred for apps store will grow, while the open web has no memory of wrong doing.
* Redux will continue to get stiff competition (see [mobx](https://mobx.js.org/)).
* YARN will win more users.
* The idea of “front-end apps”, “Thick Client apps”, “Static apps”, “No Backend app”, “SPA's”, “Front-end driven app” might get boiled down to the term/concept called ["JAM Stack"](https://jamstack.org/).
